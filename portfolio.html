	<h4> 
	The objective of this game is to catch as many fish as you can within the time limit.
	<br>
	<br> The starting menu (left image) explains the game to the user and prompts them to enter their name.
	<br> After entering their name, there will be random fish, with varying amounts of points, going across the screen for the player to catch.
	<br>By using the W and S keys to move up and down, the player will try to catch the fish and add to their score by going up to the surface.

	    <h4> 
	In this game, you make a cake from scratch-- mixing ingredients, baking the cake in the oven, and finally decorating it at the end! :D
	<br>
	<br> The user will go through a click adventure game, like clicking the strawberries to cut it and dragging ingredients to mix in a bowl.
	<br> At the end of the game, the user will be evaluated and receive a 0-3 star rating, depending on how well they made the cake without messing up.
