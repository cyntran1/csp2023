	<h4> 
	The objective of this project is to traverse space, avoid asteroids, and reach the target destination (the planet).
	<br>
	<br> After setting up the screen, the user will be asked which direction to go (up, down, right, left OR wasd keys).
	<br> If the user hits an asteroid, the losing screen will pop up. If the user makes it to the planet, the winning screen will pop up!

	<h4> 
	The objective of this game is to catch as many fish as you can within the time limit.
	<br>
	<br> The starting menu (left image) explains the game to the user and prompts them to enter their name.
	<br> After entering their name, there will be random fish, with varying amounts of points, going across the screen for the player to catch.
	<br>By using the W and S keys to move up and down, the player will try to catch the fish and add to their score by going up to the surface.

	<h4> 
	In this game, you make a cake from scratch-- mixing ingredients, baking the cake in the oven, and finally decorating it at the end! :D
	<br>
	<br> The user will go through a click adventure game and complete the different steps to making a cake by clicking and interacting with ingredients.
	<br> At the end of the game, the user will be evaluated and receive a 0-3 star rating which depends on how well they made the cake without messing up.

	<h4>
	In this project, a system breach occured in a great company. So, we were tasked to debug the unexpected errors in the fish tank monitoring system.
	<br>
	<br> To debug the program, we used print statements to check if variables, lists, and conditional expressions were assigned / worked as originally intended.
	<br> After identifying the issues, we brainstormed ideas and applied them in order to fix the program-- we did test cases to make sure it worked properly.

	<h4>
	In this project, we analyzed a simulation model based on the natural selection of peppered moths, specifically in Manchester, from NetLogo.
	<br>
	<br> We first identified the turtles, the patches, and the randomness used in the code to determine what and how the program is simulating the real-world system.
	<br> Afterward, we applied our understanding by describing the program's exclusions, brainstormed how to improve the simulation, and listed real-world issues related to the model.

    <h1>3.1.6 Project - Rover Phone Home</h1>
	<img src="images/rover.PNG" height="275">
	<h4>
	In this project, we had to identify where a lost rover is on an alien plain when given descriptions of 5 distinct locations and a single list of combined data values.
	<br>
	<br> We first had to separate the list of data values into 4 different categories (light, temperature, sound, and gyroscope) and then created 4 graphs.
	<br> Then, concluded where the rover is based on the graphs and the description of the regions. We identified that the rover is located in the Desert Plains.
